The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. So the sequence goes: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.

Here's an example of the Fibonacci sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, ...

Each number in the sequence (after the first two) is the sum of the two preceding numbers. For instance:

1 (the third number) is the sum of 0 and 1.
2 (the fourth number) is the sum of 1 and 1.
3 (the fifth number) is the sum of 1 and 2.
And so on.

## Fibonacci Sequence Generation:
Write a C program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms using a loop. 
- The program should prompt the user to enter the number of terms and then generate the Fibonacci sequence using a loop. 
- Display the Fibonacci sequence as the output.

## Run and Test
### Testcase 1:
Prompt input:
```
Enter a number: 5
```
Output:
```
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3
```
### Testcase 2:
Prompt input:
```
Enter a number: 7
```
Output:
```
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```
